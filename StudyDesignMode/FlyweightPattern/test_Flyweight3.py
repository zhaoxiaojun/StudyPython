Flyweight Design Pattern
   Desc: Sharing the shareable data between the common classes and thus
   reducing the memory usage
   Code: Believing that every person in a family will have same genetic
         structure, we will create a code to learn about
         genetics of each family. If a same member of a family is given, no new
         object is created. (You can also create new
         objects unlike here but keep a reference of the heavy weighted one in
         the new |||r object).
